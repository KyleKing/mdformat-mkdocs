### Footnotes

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

  [^1]: My reference.
  [^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.\
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
  [^note]: Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.\
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
